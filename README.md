# ai-loan-approval-predictor
This is a binary classification model using the XGBoost algorithm to predict the risk of approving a loan.

The file is separated in three easy steps:

1. Create an Estimator - 
copy paste the code under STEP 1. The code will run for a few minutes and will end up with a success message:

2. Deploy the Estimator -
copy paste the code under STEP 2, is actually just one line of code to deploy the model, and an optional second line to validate that the Estimator exists

3. Run predictions - 
copy paste the code under STEP 3. The model is now deployed and ready to make predictions. The model will return the probability in this case a 99% that the loan should be approved:
